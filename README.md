## 🛡️ Introduction

**CFnew** is a state-of-the-art, all-in-one proxy solution running on Cloudflare Workers. It is designed to be **unblockable**, **fast**, and **easy to manage**.

*   **Serverless**: No VPS required. Runs on Cloudflare's global edge network (300+ cities).
*   **No-Code Management**: Manage everything (UUID, IPs, Protocols) via a beautiful "Matrix-style" Web Dashboard.
*   **Polymorphic**: Acts as VLESS, Trojan, and a normal website simultaneously.
*   **Smart Routing**: Automatically selects the best route based on your region.
*   **Expanded Regions**: Supports region detection for US, SG, JP, KR, DE, SE, NL, FI, GB, FR, CA, AU, HK, TW, IT, ES, RU, UA, BR, IN, ZA.
*   **Legacy IPs**: Includes a robust list of Legacy IPs (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) to bypass restrictions in sensitive regions like Iran.

> **Note:** The final `worker.js` file is minified/obscured for performance and compactness.

## 🧠 The Mailman Analogy: How it Works

To understand how this tool bypasses censorship, imagine a **Secure Postal Service**.

### 1. The Disguise 🎭
You want to send a letter to **YouTube** (a blocked location).
Instead of mailing it directly, you put it in an envelope addressed to **Cloudflare** (a allowed business).
The Inspector (Firewall) sees the address "Cloudflare" and lets it pass.

### 2. The Verification 🔐
On the back of the envelope, you place a special, invisible stamp called a **UUID**.
When the letter arrives at Cloudflare, the Worker checks this stamp.
*   **No stamp?** The letter is thrown away.
*   **Valid stamp?** The Worker opens the envelope, reads your actual request ("Go to YouTube"), and fetches the data for you.

### 3. The Delivery 🚚
The Worker gets the data from YouTube and sends it back to you in a Cloudflare envelope.
To the outside world, you are just talking to Cloudflare.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deployment
1.  Copy the code from `worker.js`.
2.  Paste it into a new Cloudflare Worker.
3.  Deploy.

### 2. Configuration
1.  Go to Worker Settings -> Variables.
2.  Add `u` = `YOUR_UUID` (Generate one [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)).
3.  Add KV Namespace binding named `C` (Required for dashboard settings).

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Warning**
> 1. **Protect your UUID**: The dashboard URL contains your secret UUID. Do not share it.
>    - Recommended: protect the dashboard path with Cloudflare Access (or at least an IP allowlist / geo restriction).
>    - Stronger: require a second factor (e.g., a secret header or `?token=`) and reject requests without it.
> 2. **DoH abuse risk**: If you expose the `/dns-query` endpoint publicly, it can be abused as an open resolver. Add access controls if you enable it.

### 3. Usage
Visit: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/<YOUR_UUID>`
